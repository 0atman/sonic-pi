# Contributors

We would like to express our sincerest thanks and gratitude to everyone
that has helped with either the development of Sonic Pi or supported its
use in any capacity. On its own Sonic Pi is just a piece of
software. Only when combined with our kind and generous community does
it become a powerful tool for sharing and celebrating the creativity of
code. Thank-you everyone.


## A humble beginning 

The start of any project is a fragile period which relies heavily on the
generous support of others. We would like to offer our considered
gratitude to the following people who provided support in the early days
of Sonic Pi with their time, advice, and wisdom:

## Core Team Thanks

Sam Aaron would like to express his deep thanks to his family and
friends who have supported him over the years and given him the strength
to continue on this strange and often unforgiving path. He would
particularly like to thank his friend and partner Susanna and also his
fab Mum.

Luis Lloret wants to thank his wonderful family for their understanding and support
while working on this. Specially Marina, you are my reason to live. Mar and Darío, 
keep being so special and giving us so much joy.

Xavier Riley would like to thank his wife Emily, and he'd like to reassure her that he definitely loves 
her more than any computer. Also big thanks to conference organizers, in particular Simon Starr for putting
on the awesome Bath Ruby conferences and letting me rock out there not [once](https://youtu.be/Jp0VKD_7pmw?t=10m1s),
but [twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L06FlSoiBi4). Lastly I'd like to thank Scott Wilson for teaching me
some programming as part of a music degree, and my good friend David Bamber for helping me get started as a programmer.
